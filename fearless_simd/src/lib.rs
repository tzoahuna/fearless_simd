//! `fearless_simd` takes `unsafe` out of SIMD.
//!
//! No matter what level of abstraction you're after, be it autovectorization and multiversioning, or portable SIMD, or safe access to raw
//! intrinsics and nothing more, `fearless_simd` has you covered!
//!
//! Zero dependencies, from-scratch build time under 1 second, safe public APIs, and [very little](https://gist.github.com/Shnatsel/61fc294987a1e051ce3835c97dc0fc19) `unsafe` under the hood.
//!
//! # Automatic vectorization
//!
//! Put the code to vectorize in an `#[inline(always)]` function generic over [`Simd`].
//!
//! This will generate several implementations for different SIMD levels and select the best one at runtime:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use fearless_simd::{dispatch, Level, Simd};
//!
//! #[inline(always)]
//! fn double_u32s<S: Simd>(_: S, values: &mut [u32]) {
//!     for value in values {
//!         *value = *value * 2;
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let mut values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//! let level = Level::new(); // Detect SIMD available on the CPU. Expensive, so do it once.
//! dispatch!(level, simd => double_u32s(simd, &mut values));
//! assert_eq!(values, [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]);
//! ```
//!
//! # Portable SIMD
//!
//! Use the vector types for explicit lane-wise operations while staying generic over the SIMD level:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use fearless_simd::{dispatch, prelude::*, Level};
//!
//! #[inline(always)]
//! fn double_u32s<S: Simd>(simd: S, values: &mut [u32]) {
//!     let mut chunks = values.chunks_exact_mut(S::u32s::N); // the CPU's native SIMD width
//!     for chunk in &mut chunks {
//!         let v = S::u32s::from_slice(simd, chunk);
//!         (v * 2).store_slice(chunk);
//!     }
//!     for value in chunks.into_remainder() {
//!         *value = *value * 2;
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let mut values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//! let level = Level::new(); // Detect SIMD available on the CPU. Expensive, so do it once.
//! dispatch!(level, simd => double_u32s(simd, &mut values));
//! assert_eq!(values, [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]);
//! ```
//!
//! You can also use fixed-size types such as [u32x8] instead of using the hardware's native SIMD width.
//!
//! # Explicit intrinsics
//!
//! If you need access to raw intrinsics, [`kernel!`][kernel] creates a function where they can be called safely:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use fearless_simd::{prelude::*, Level, u32x4};
//!
//! fearless_simd::kernel!(
//!     fn double_u32s_neon(neon: Neon, values: &mut [u32]) {
//!         use core::arch::aarch64::*;
//!
//!         let mut chunks = values.chunks_exact_mut(4);
//!         for chunk in &mut chunks {
//!             let v: uint32x4_t = u32x4::from_slice(neon, chunk).into(); // safe load
//!             let doubled = vmulq_u32(v, vdupq_n_u32(2)); // safe access to a NEON intrinsic
//!             let doubled: u32x4<_> = doubled.simd_into(neon);
//!             doubled.store_slice(chunk);
//!         }
//!         for value in chunks.into_remainder() {
//!             *value = *value * 2;
//!         }
//!     }
//! );
//!
//! #[cfg(target_arch = "aarch64")]
//! {
//!     let level = Level::new(); // Detect SIMD available on the CPU. Expensive, so do it once.
//!     if let Some(neon) = level.as_neon() {
//!         let mut values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//!         double_u32s_neon(neon, &mut values);
//!         assert_eq!(values, [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You can also [mix and match](https://github.com/linebender/fearless_simd/blob/main/fearless_simd/examples/srgb.rs)
//! intrinsics with the other approaches, using high-level code most of the time and dropping down to
//! hardware-specific intrinsics only when necessary.
//!
//! # Inlining
//!
//! Fearless SIMD relies heavily on Rust's inlining support to create functions which have the given target features enabled.
//!
//! As a rule of thumb:
//!
//! - All SIMD functions need `#[inline(always)]`.
//! - Use [`dispatch`] when calling SIMD code from non-SIMD code.
//! - Use [`vectorize()`][Simd::vectorize] when calling SIMD from SIMD if you don't want to force inlining.
//!
//! [The article describing the design](https://gist.github.com/Shnatsel/61fc294987a1e051ce3835c97dc0fc19#the-abi-would-like-a-word) covers why this is the
//! case. There's also Q&A on [Zulip](https://xi.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/514230-simd/topic/inlining/with/546913433).
//!
//! # Instruction set support
//!
//! - x86/x86-64: [v2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels) (SSE4.2), [v3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels) (AVX2)
//! - Aarch64: Baseline [NEON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_architecture_family#Advanced_SIMD_(Neon))
//! - WebAssembly: [128-bit packed SIMD](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/blob/main/proposals/simd/SIMD.md), [relaxed SIMD](https://github.com/WebAssembly/relaxed-simd/blob/main/proposals/relaxed-simd/Overview.md)
//!
//! A scalar fallback is also provided for platforms, so your code still works even if SIMD is not available.
//!
//! # WebAssembly
//!
//! WASM SIMD doesn't have feature detection, and so you need to compile two versions of your bundle for WASM, one with SIMD and one without,
//! then select the appropriate one for your user's browser. This can be done via [the `wasm-feature-detect`
//! library](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/wasm-feature-detect).
//!
//! You can compile WebAssembly with the SIMD128 feature enabled via the `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable
//! (`RUSTFLAGS="-Ctarget-feature=+simd128"`), or by adding the compiler flags in your [Cargo
//! config.toml](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html):
//!
//! ```toml
//! [target.'cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")']
//! rustflags = ["-Ctarget-feature=+simd128"]
//! rustdocflags = ["-Ctarget-feature=+simd128"]
//! ```
//!
//! If you want to compile both SIMD and non-SIMD versions of your WebAssembly library, your best option right now is to create a shell script
//! that builds it once with the `RUSTFLAGS` specified, and once without. [Cargo currently does not allow specifying compiler flags
//! per-profile.](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10271)
//!
//! ## Relaxed SIMD
//!
//! Fearless SIMD can make use of the [relaxed SIMD](https://github.com/WebAssembly/relaxed-simd/blob/main/proposals/relaxed-simd/Overview.md)
//! WebAssembly instructions, if the requisite target feature is enabled. These instructions can return implementation-dependent results
//! depending on what is fastest on the underlying hardware. They are only used for operations where we already give hardware-dependent results.
//!
//! At the time of writing, relaxed SIMD is only supported in Chrome. To make use of it, you'll need to build two versions of your library, one
//! with relaxed SIMD enabled (`RUSTFLAGS="-Ctarget-feature=+simd128,+relaxed-simd"`) and one with it disabled, and then feature-detect at
//! runtime.
//!
//! # Credits
//!
//! This crate was inspired by [`pulp`], [`std::simd`], among others in the Rust ecosystem, though makes many decisions differently.
//! It benefited from conversations with Luca Versari, though he is not responsible for any of the mistakes or bad decisions.
//!
//! # Feature Flags
//!
//! The following crate [feature flags](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#dependency-features) are available:
//!
//! - `std` (enabled by default): Get floating point functions from the standard library (likely using your target's libc).
//!   Also allows using [`Level::new`] on all platforms, to detect which target features are enabled.
//! - `libm`: Use floating point implementations from [libm].
//! - `force_support_fallback`: Force scalar fallback, to be supported, even if your compilation target has a better baseline.
//!
//! At least one of `std` and `libm` is required; `std` overrides `libm`.
//!
